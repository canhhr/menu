👉 Usage;

👉  With this menu program, you can simultaneously use our products in the ⁠counterstrafe and ⁠autocrouch channels, or you can enable one feature while keeping the other disabled. You can use both of these features regardless of whether you're playing an FPS or TPS game. Once you enable the features, you can activate them with F1 and disable them with F2. The Counterstrafe feature helps you automatically stop when you fire in the game, while the Autocrouch feature automatically crouches when you fire. Instead of purchasing the programs separately from the mentioned channels, you can save your money and have access to more features by purchasing this program at a reasonable price. There are no risks or ban risks associated with using the application. Sample pictures;
